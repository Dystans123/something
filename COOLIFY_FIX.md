# Coolify 502 Error Fix

## Problem
Your production deployment shows healthy API endpoints but 502 Bad Gateway errors for static assets (CSS, JS files) in browser console.

## Root Cause
Static file serving middleware was incorrectly configured, causing asset requests to return 502 instead of proper files.

## Solution Applied
Created `server/production-fixed.ts` with proper static file handling:

- Static files served before SPA routing
- Proper MIME types for assets
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Separate handling for `/assets/*` routes
- Better error responses for missing files

## Updated Files
- `server/index-production.ts` - Uses fixed static serving
- `server/production-fixed.ts` - New static file handler
- `Dockerfile` - Updated build process

## Deploy to Coolify
1. Push updated code to your repository
2. Trigger new deployment in Coolify
3. Monitor logs for: `[production] Serving static files from: /app/dist/public`
4. Check browser console - 502 errors should be resolved

## Verification
After deployment, these should work:
- Main page loads without console errors
- CSS styles apply correctly
- JavaScript functionality works
- `/api/health` continues responding

The fix maintains backward compatibility while resolving the static asset serving issue causing your 502 errors.
