Design and build a fully free psychological test experience called Shadow Test, inspired by Jungian psychology. The purpose of the site is to help users uncover their unconscious Shadow archetype through 40 projection-based questions. The final result reveals one dominant archetype from a set of 8.

ðŸŒ‘ Aesthetic and Design
Color Palette: Deep black and metalic silver (more metalic silver)
Use gradients from black to silver, soft glows, rich shadows. Prioritize a mysterious and elegant contrast.

Background:
Dark gradient (black to silver) with micro-animations - floating smoke effect 
Typography:
Modern serif or sleek sans-serif fonts. White or silver text on a dark background.

Mood:
Mysterious, cinematic, psychologically intense â€” should evoke introspection and curiosity.

ðŸ’¥ Hero Section (Landing Page)
Visual Element (above the headline):
Instead of a single figure, place eight shadowy human silhouettes across the top of the page â€” each subtly representing one of the 8 archetypes.

These figures should be:

Faceless or partially obscured

Rendered in matte black, standing against the silver-black gradient

Slightly different in posture or gesture to reflect their archetype's energy (e.g. one defiant, one withdrawn, one seductive, etc.)

Optionally animated with slow fading, subtle movement, or glitch effects to enhance psychological depth

Their arrangement should evoke mystery and psychological multiplicity â€” as if they are parts of a fragmented psyche.

Headline Text (copy as-is):

You are more than who you appear to be.
Beneath the surface lies your Shadow â€” parts of you you deny, fear, or hide.
Answer 40 projection questions to reveal your Shadow archetype.
But beware â€” once you see it, you canâ€™t unsee it.

ðŸ§ª The Test Page
Include exactly 40 projection-based questions (provided in the document questions).

Each question has 8 answer choices â€” the user must select one.

Important:
Do not display the archetype mappings or point values in the UI. These are for internal result calculations only.

Style:
Minimalist black interface. Use smooth animated transitions between questions. Subtle motion (e.g. background shimmer or soft flicker) is encouraged.

ðŸ§  Results Page
After the test, determine which of the 8 archetypes the user matched most closely based on their answers.

Display:

The name of the dominant archetype

Its full psychological description (from the archetypes document)

A dynamic visual (symbol, silhouette, or minimalist animation) that represents the archetype

CTA:
Share your shadow â€” button to share result on social media with the archetypeâ€™s name and symbol.

ðŸ”® Archetypes Page (Accessible from "View Archetypes" Button)
Available anytime via a separate button on the landing page.

Display all 8 archetypes, each with:

Full uncut psychological description

An optional icon, symbol, or visual motif that represents it

Allow users to explore and compare the archetypes freely.

ðŸ›  Technical / UX Requirements
The entire test and experience must be 100% free â€” no sign-up or login required.

Must be fully responsive and work smoothly on desktop and mobile.

Prioritize:

Fast loading

Clean, cinematic transitions

Immersive user experience

Archetype logic and descriptions will be provided â€” you only need to implement the logic invisibly and display the final result.
